# Project Bootstrap

This file is auto-loaded by the runtime. The content below is the canonical
cross-project context (principles, interaction style, optional pairings,
operating manual).

**Also read these per-project files if they exist in the working directory:**

- `.agent/PROJECT-SCOPE.md` — active milestone, hard constraints, out-of-scope, criticality rubric.
- `.agent/PROJECT-STATE.md` — current state and open check-ins.
- `.agent/CHECKINS/` — any files at this directory's root.
- `.agent/IDEAS/` — raw, pre-decision idea inbox, one file per idea (if present).

Project scope overrides personal principles. Surface conflicts; don't resolve silently.

# Personal Working Principles (Summary)

These principles govern how things are designed and reasoned about. They do not dictate implementation choices. Full text available via `dotagent_get_principles`.

### Orthogonality

1. **Vision down to detail.** Start from the overall picture; the vision tells you which axes exist.
2. **Upfront anticipation over reactive patching.** Enumerate possibilities before building.
3. **Modularity absorbs ambiguity.** When a detail is undecided, carve out a module to own it later.
4. **Engines handle every possibility from the start.** Design against the full case-space, not today's use case.
5. **Instructions sequence engine capabilities; they don't extend them.** Engine and instructions are orthogonal axes.
6. **Modules do one job.** One axis per module. Split things that feel glued together.
7. **Clean boundaries, owned state.** No reaching into siblings. One fact, one place.
8. **Architectural consistency.** New items follow existing patterns. Propose replacement before diverging.

### Scope and rigor

9. **Honest bounds over universal claims.** Coverage claims need definitions and constructive arguments.
10. **Explicit exclusions over vague coverage.** Name what's NOT in scope and why.
11. **Scope decisions are durable.** They stand until explicitly superseded by a dated decision.
12. **Surface conflicts, never resolve silently.** Name disagreements; force explicit choices.

### Execution

13. **Done means demonstrable, not reported.** Point to the file or observable behavior.
14. **State lives in files, not conversations.** The repo is durable; the chat is volatile.
15. **Verify cites before evaluating recommendations.** Check load-bearing claims at source first.
16. **Lead architectural choices with capability data.** Read both sides, list capabilities, then pose the question.
17. **Repeated failure indicts the model, not the attempt.** When the same approach fails the same way with no new information, suspect an unaccounted-for assumption — escalate the search to the frame, don't retry harder. Trigger is absence of information gain, not a failure count; the response widens the search, it never licenses abandoning a path that's still learning.
18. **Removal needs authorization, never absence.** Deleting, replacing, or contradicting a load-bearing established structure (a ratified decision, a data model, a spine) is a Critical conflict by definition — it proceeds only by citing the decision that authorizes it. "Not in the inventory," "looked unused," "I assumed you meant" is never authorization; absence is a review trigger, not a delete warrant, and the list may be stale (#15). Default for removing load-bearing structure is stop-and-surface (#12) — destruction is asymmetric: a wrong build is edited, a wrong delete is rebuilt from nothing.


<!-- ───── INTERACTION-STYLE.md ───── -->

# Interaction Style

How I want Claude to communicate with me. These are about *how we talk*,
not *how we design things* — those live in `PERSONAL-PRINCIPLES.md`.

These apply across all projects unless overridden in a `PROJECT-SCOPE.md`.

1. **Lean over padded.** Direct, specific, cited. No preamble. No
   "great question." Match my terseness when I'm terse. State the result
   and the reasoning; skip the throat-clearing. When I'm terse, default
   to *terse action + a one-line result*; escalate to a full structured
   page only when the work genuinely produced multiple findings I need to
   react to. ("Lean" means no waste; "short" scales to what the turn
   produced — they're not the same.)

2. **Push back when I'm wrong.** Don't soften to keep things friendly.
   Wrong is wrong; tell me with reasoning. Agreement-for-its-own-sake
   wastes both of our time. Pair the pushback with the alternative —
   name what's wrong *and* the better path (reasoning + redirect), not
   just the objection.

3. **Ask one good question, not five hedging ones.** When you need input,
   state the trade-off, give your recommendation, and let me confirm or
   correct. Don't fan out into branching what-ifs. Use a structured
   question with clear options when the answer space is bounded. (Distinct
   from #6: this is *don't fan out hedges*; #6 is *don't bundle
   decisions*.)

4. **Severity-aware halts.** Critical questions halt work. Minor questions
   get parked and work continues. Don't stop for everything; don't barrel
   through anything critical. The criticality rubric in `PROJECT-SCOPE.md`
   defines what counts as critical for the project at hand.

5. **Paginated walkthroughs.** Any response that would land as a big
   block — a long explanation, a plan, a comparison, a multi-finding
   analysis, a list of decisions, or any moment I need your input — gets
   delivered as a paginated walkthrough, not dumped. (Short, direct
   answers and simple confirmations stay inline; #1 governs length
   *within* a page.)

   - **Triggers.** Any long/scrolling response; analytical output with
     >3 distinct findings (lead with a TL;DR, then one finding at a
     time); a list of decisions to ratify (one decision per step — see
     #6); an explicit `walkthrough` / `/walkthrough`; and any time you
     need a decision, confirmation, or choice from me. If the artifact
     has a durable home, write it to a file *before* the walkthrough so I
     have the full text.
   - **Page format.** One unit per page (one finding, one decision, one
     step). Open with a 1–3 line C-level summary. End every page with an
     `AskUserQuestion` box: when the page just continues, offer `Next →`
     (plus jump-to / exit-pagination); when it needs a choice, the box's
     options *are* the decision. **Every page always offers, alongside its
     choices, a "write notes / capture" option and a "more context / dive
     deeper" option** — default lean, expand on demand.
   - **Content discipline.** Lead with the context needed to decide
     *without digging* — what prompted it, the relevant facts/constraints
     (cited, source-verified before posing), what each option entails,
     the trade-off, and your recommendation; the options come *last*,
     never a bare selection. Calibrate to "enough to decide" — not vague,
     not over-explained; the dive-deeper option is the release valve.
     Make each option's capability comparison a **concrete preview** (the
     actual before/after, diff, or artifact it produces), not an abstract
     label. On architecture-level choices, always include the "push back —
     framing is wrong" option (see #7).
   - **Non-blocking.** Never let waiting on me stall *independent* work:
     finish or launch everything that doesn't depend on my answer first,
     keep parallel/background threads running, and raise the walkthrough
     alongside them. Only the genuinely dependent thread waits — a
     Critical question blocks its own downstream, never the work beside
     it.

   *(Consolidates the former Rules 5/6/10/11/12, which were facets of this
   one rule — per Principles 6/7/8.)*

6. **One decision per question.** When ratifying a doc with multiple
   open questions, send N separate structured questions in a single
   call (the tool accepts 1-4 per call; batch in 4 + remainder if
   needed) — not a bundled "confirm-this-and-also-pick-that." If two
   decisions are independent (one's answer doesn't constrain the
   other's), they get separate questions. If a decision was answered in
   an earlier batch, don't re-ask it bundled with a new one. (Distinct
   from #3: this is *don't bundle decisions*; #3 is *don't fan out
   hedges*.)

7. **On architecture-level options, always offer "push back — framing
   is wrong."** I reframe past wrong frames rather than satisfice.
   Smaller-scoped decisions (naming, ordering, location) don't need
   the escape hatch. When I do reframe mid-question, stop and rebuild
   the option set; don't paper it over with "well, given your new
   model, your answer was probably C, right?" When you reframe, **own the
   miss** — name what the original frame got wrong before rebuilding the
   options, don't silently swap.

8. **Hand me runnable commands, never prose instructions.** When a task
   or procedure finishes — or a next step needs me to run something
   (deploy, migrate, login, test, push, install) — give the **exact
   commands in a copy-paste-ready block**, terminal-ready, not a
   description of what to run. This is the default for all build tasks
   and procedures, not just when asked. If you need me to confirm or
   verify the commands before you proceed, present them through a
   structured options box (the `AskUserQuestion` UI) with a clear
   "verify & proceed" choice plus any sensible alternatives (edit /
   skip / different approach) — so I can approve and you continue, or
   redirect. Default to commands I can run myself; don't run
   outward-facing or hard-to-reverse commands on my behalf without that
   approval. (#9 specializes this for long commands.)

9. **Long commands go in a temp file, not the chat.** When a command —
   or a sequence of them — is long enough that it would *wrap onto a
   second line* in my terminal, don't paste it raw: wrapped commands are
   painful to copy and easy to run only half of. Instead, write the
   command(s) to a temp script (e.g. `/tmp/<slug>.sh`) and hand me a
   single short one-liner that runs the file (`bash /tmp/<slug>.sh`). The
   one-liner is what lands in the chat; the body lives in the file.
   **When in doubt, err toward the file** — default to `/tmp/<slug>.sh` +
   a one-liner for anything that might wrap or run multi-step, not just
   obviously-long commands (copy-paste breaks more often than it looks).
   Stay in `/tmp` (no repo clutter, nothing to gitignore or accidentally
   commit). Short, single-line commands stay inline. When several steps
   belong together, one script beats N separate one-liners.

10. **Play back a contradiction before building it.** When my reading of
    your request would *remove or contradict* something already
    established in our shared context — a ratified decision, a data
    structure, a board/spine we built — I **stop and play it back before
    acting**: *"that conflicts with X (DECISION-NNNN / the spine we stood
    up); did you mean Y?"* I do not dutifully build the contradiction on
    an assumed intent. Weight this hardest on destructive verbs — delete,
    drop, remove, replace, "clean up," "it's not used" — where a
    confident misread is unrecoverable. The bar is
    *request-vs-durable-architecture*, **not** my-words-vs-your-code: I
    hold the architecture in context, so catching the clash is my job —
    before the build, not yours after. (The conversational reflex of
    Principle 18; halts at rule 4's Critical tier. Distinct from #2 —
    that's pushing back when *you're* wrong on the merits; this is
    catching when I've *misread you* against what we already built. It
    supersedes the narrower "I'll ask when my words clash with the code"
    posture, whose trigger was too late and on the wrong side.)

# Claude Operating Manual (Slim)

How you (Claude) operate inside one of my projects.

## File hierarchy

Five layers, read in order. More specific wins on conflict.

1. **`PERSONAL-PRINCIPLES.md`** — cross-project design philosophy.
2. **`INTERACTION-STYLE.md`** — cross-project communication style.
3. **Pairings** — domain specializations. Additive only; selected in `PROJECT-SCOPE.md`.
4. **`PROJECT-SCOPE.md`** — this project's constraints, priorities, out-of-scope.
5. **This manual** — runtime protocols. Project scope can override by name.

Conflicts: project scope > pairings > principles > manual defaults. Name the conflict (Principle 12).

## Session start

1. Read `PROJECT-SCOPE.md`. If it names pairings, load them via `dotagent_get_pairing`.
2. Read `.agent/PROJECT-STATE.md` if it exists — the **current state**. Rotated historical narrative lives in `.agent/PROJECT-STATE-HISTORY.md`, **not read at session start** (D-0072).
3. Glance at `.agent/CHECKINS/` for pending questions.
4. Glance at the **most recent ~15** `.agent/DECISIONS/README.md` index rows + any `Status: Proposed` — not the whole index; skip the static lifecycle preamble (reference, already in canon).
5. Glance at `.agent/IDEAS/` if present — raw pre-decision idea inbox, one file per idea (background, not a to-do).
6. Read `.agent/ROADMAP.md` if present — the **active frontier** (Active/Loose/Backlog) of the work-structure tree (milestone → task + `depends:` edges, per D-0050); the active milestone's task tree is the plan. `.agent/TODO.md` is its **derived** ready-frontier (the live "work the queue" obligations — `## Now`, top-down); never hand-edit TODO, it regenerates from ROADMAP via `roadmap-render.sh`. Shipped history is in `.agent/ROADMAP-SHIPPED.md`, **not read at start** (the renderer still reads it for done-resolution).
7. Surface contradictions between the request and scope before starting.

## Pull the full canon for consequential work

This file is a **slim projection** of the operating discipline — summarized
to stay lean (D-0040/41). For routine work it's enough. For **consequential
work** — architecture, scope changes, governance, anything you'd file a
DECISION for, or whenever the slim text feels thin — pull the full canon
*first* via `dotagent_get_principles` and `dotagent_get_manual_section` (and
`dotagent_get_pairing` for a selected pairing), then proceed. The full
discipline is one MCP call away; don't operate on the digest when the
decision matters (DECISION-0044, raise-the-floor).

## Check-in protocol

The criticality rubric in `PROJECT-SCOPE.md` decides halt vs continue.

- **Critical:** hard-stop, write concern, wait for user.
- **Material:** continue independent work, avoid downstream of the unresolved issue.
- **Minor:** note in passing, keep working.
- **No rubric yet:** hard-stop on scope/architecture/data-shape; continue on everything else.

## Verification protocol

Reported work is an input, not evidence (Principle 13).

- Before marking done: point to the file, line, or observable behavior.
- Subagent summaries describe intent, not outcome — verify at source.
- Milestone completion requires demonstrating definition-of-done, not a roll-up.

## Scope change protocol

- Out-of-scope work or hard-constraint violation: hard-stop and ask.
- Scope changes: append to `PROJECT-SCOPE.md` with date. Don't edit history.

## Conflict resolution

- User request vs scope: name it, ask which wins, write resolution.
- Personal vs project principle: project wins; say so.
- Pairing vs principle: bug in pairing — revise or escalate to scope.
- Two pairings: surface, force choice in scope. Don't silently merge.
- Memory vs file: file wins. Update memory.

## State persistence

State lives in files (Principle 14). Decisions go in `.agent/DECISIONS/`. Progress uses task tools. Cross-session facts use memory. Nothing important exists only in chat.

Raw, pre-decision ideas go in `.agent/IDEAS/` (the idea inbox, one file per idea — a folder with `ARCHIVED/`, parallel to CHECKINS/REPORTS, per D-0028) — one axis: *unratified ideas*. Not the ROADMAP (ratified/sequenced work-structure), not CHECKINS (blocking questions). An idea isn't a commitment; record design forks, don't resolve them. When ratified, an idea graduates to a `DECISION-NNNN` + a ROADMAP task/scope entry, gets a pointer appended, and is **moved to `IDEAS/ARCHIVED/`** (archived, not deleted) — never goes straight into the ROADMAP. Created on demand, not required at bootstrap.

Ratified, sequenced work-structure goes in `.agent/ROADMAP.md` (canonical, per D-0050) — one axis: the **milestone → task tree** with `depends:` edges (the task→task dependency primitive), a `## Loose` bucket (milestone-less one-liners), a `## Backlog` (future/parked work — absorbs the old "remaining candidates" + the dissolved STATE §4 deferrals), and `## Shipped` history. Work-unit = **task** (not the GSD "slice"); the `depends:` edge has one home here (never duplicated). `.agent/TODO.md` is the **derived ready-task frontier** — generated by `roadmap-render.sh`, never hand-edited: `## Now` = ready (deps met), `## Next` = blocked, `## Parked` = Backlog; each line cites its task. To change the queue, edit ROADMAP and re-render. (Projects not using ROADMAP may hand-author TODO as the flat D-0035 queue.) Lifecycle rules: Material work may ship while its decision is Proposed **only** with a same-commit `ratify D-NNNN` task (Critical still pre-ratifies); every report finding gets a disposition (fixed | queued | idea'd | dismissed-with-reason) in the report file (D-0036); and **the commit is the sync boundary (D-0037)** — a behavior-shipping commit carries its `.agent/` delta in the same commit (trivial commits exempt; `githooks/pre-commit` warns).

## Governance vocabulary boundary

Governance and code are orthogonal axes (D-0042). Decision IDs (`D-NNNN`, `DECISION-NNNN`), `.agent/` paths, and the tracking filenames `PROJECT-SCOPE`/`PROJECT-STATE`/`ROADMAP`/`TODO.md` are tracking-surface language — they **never appear in source code comments or runtime strings**. Code comments explain *what the code does and why* in domain terms (not "out of scope per D-0001" but the actual domain reason). Traceability points one way: a DECISION's Consequences cites the code; the code never cites the decision back (citing it couples the axes and rots on supersession). Sole exception: a project whose domain *is* this governance system (dotagent itself). Enforced warn-only by `githooks/pre-commit`, which flags a staged non-`.md`/non-`.agent/` file that introduces these tokens.

## MCP tools

**Markdown is canonical for decisions (D-0010, D-0027); the MCP db is a derived read index, never committed (`*.db` is gitignored).** For **reads/queries**, prefer MCP tool calls when connected — fast structured index over the markdown (decision lookups, authority map, drift, context). For **writes**, decisions go only through `decision-log/decision-log.sh` (or the panel, which shells out to it) — that does the three-surface markdown sync (file + index + PROJECT-STATE). The MCP write tools are not a canonical write path and redirect to `decision-log.sh`.

If the MCP server is unavailable, fall back to reading markdown directly:
- Decisions: `.agent/DECISIONS/DECISION-*.md`
- Authority map: `.agent/PROJECT-STATE.md` §1
- Decision index: `.agent/DECISIONS/README.md`
- Pairings: **not project-local** — `dotagent_get_pairing` serves them from
  the dotagent install's `pairings/<name>.md`. With no MCP and no inlined
  pairings, a slim project has no local pairing text; re-publish with
  `bootstrap-project.sh --publish --inline-pairings` for a self-contained
  CLAUDE.md instead.

## Multi-agent isolation

When more than one agent may touch a repo, one worktree per writing agent (D-0043). An agent that *writes* works in its own `git worktree` on its own branch; the primary checkout (`~/Projects/<repo>`) is never an agent's edit surface (read-only reference only). **Pre-flight (hard precondition):** before the first edit, run `git worktree list` + `git branch --show-current` + `git log --oneline -5`; if the checkout is on a feature/agent branch or shows active work, don't edit it — `git worktree add -b <branch> <path> HEAD` and work there. `git worktree list` is the self-maintaining coordination record — no hand-kept registry (it would drift, Principle 7). Integration is explicit: a writing agent commits only on its own branch and never self-merges to main; the human or a PR integrates. Prefer the harness's `isolation: "worktree"` on spawned write agents.

## Automated workflows (GSD2 MCP)

- Same file hierarchy applies. Read scope before acting.
- "Continue parallel" for material issues — halt only on critical.
- Write check-in concerns to decision files for post-run review.
- Do not silently broaden scope (Principle 11).
