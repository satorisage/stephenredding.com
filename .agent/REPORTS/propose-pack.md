# Pair Proposal — Interview Pack

You are conducting a short, structured interview to help the user
select **pairings** for a project. A pairing is a domain-specialized
rendition of the user's principles in a specific area (a language,
framework, methodology, hardware domain, or skill). The user runs
this pack at project bootstrap (or when revisiting an existing
project) to figure out which existing pairings fit and where gaps
remain.

Read the **Available pairings** catalog below, then conduct the
interview as described in the **Interview** section, then produce a
recommendation in the **Output format** the user expects.

---

## Available pairings

### `agile-methodologies`

- **Title:** Agile Methodologies
- **Pairs with:** Agile software project management — the value system and its four working traditions (Scrum, Kanban, XP, Lean) as a *methodology family*, not one framework.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #3, #6, #7, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #16, #17
- **Preamble:** Agile is not a process you install; it is a bet that **value emerges fastest through short feedback loops over a working increment**, and that the plan is a living artifact you inspect and adapt rather than a contract you execute. The four traditions emphasize different loops — Scrum a *time-boxed cadence* and empirical control (transparency → inspection → adaptation), Kanban *continuous flow* under work-in-progress limits, XP *engineering feedback* (tests, pairing, small releases), Lean *waste elimination* and deferring commitment to the last responsible moment — but they share one spine: reality is discovered by shipping, so optimize the loop that exposes it. The principles below show where that spine already lives inside this collection's framing, and where agile sharpens a principle the collection states more generally.

### `android`

- **Title:** Android
- **Pairs with:** native Android development — Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, the lifecycle and process model, coroutines/Flow, the official app-architecture layering (UI / domain / data), background-work scheduling, the permission model, and the realities of an OS that kills your process, fragments across API levels and OEMs, and meters your battery use. Covers the platform layer: how Android's execution model shapes design. Out of scope: cross-platform wrappers (Flutter/RN/Capacitor have their own pairings if needed), Play Store release operations, and visual design language (Material is referenced only where it is architecture).
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #13
- **Preamble:** Android's defining fact is that **your process is a guest**. The OS recreates your UI on rotation, kills your process in the background and resurrects it expecting yesterday's state, defers your scheduled work to save battery, and runs your code on thousands of device/OS/OEM permutations you will never see. Designs that treat the happy path — app foregrounded, process alive, permission granted, network up — as *the* path aren't simplified; they're wrong, and they fail in the field where you can't attach a debugger. Every principle below is the general principle bent around that fact.

### `arch-linux`

- **Title:** Arch Linux
- **Pairs with:** Arch Linux and Arch-derived rolling distributions (developed on CachyOS; nothing here is CachyOS-specific). Applies to any project that *configures a machine* — dotfiles repos, system-provisioning scripts, declarative `/etc` + `~` management — on a pacman/ALPM base.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** Arch gives you a bare, rolling, *unopinionated* base: no distro-blessed config layer, no `dconf`-style central store, no "the distro will reconcile it for you." Whatever shape your machine has, **you** imposed it, and a rolling release means the ground moves under that shape continuously. The principles below specialize for the two facts that dominate Arch system-config: there is no authority but yours (so reproducibility is a build artifact, not a given), and the package manager owns a large slice of the filesystem you are tempted to edit (so boundaries are not negotiable — pacman will win).

### `audio-circuitry`

- **Title:** Audio Circuitry (Analog + Digital)
- **Pairs with:** Audio signal-chain design end-to-end — analog (signal levels, impedance, gain staging, filtering, op-amp circuits, grounding/shielding) and digital (ADC/DAC, sample rate, bit depth, clock domains, I²S/TDM framing, anti-aliasing/reconstruction). Applies to any project with an audio input or output stage, from a single line-out to a full multi-channel mixer.
- **Touches principles:** #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #13
- **Preamble:** The audio signal chain is mixed-signal end-to-end. Analog and digital are not separate worlds — they are stages of one path, and the worst failure modes happen at the boundaries between them (the codec, the power-supply rails feeding both domains, the ground topology). The principles below treat the chain as a single engine with substages, and call out the analog/digital boundary as the most failure-prone point in the entire signal path.

### `azure-app-service`

- **Title:** Azure App Service
- **Pairs with:** Azure App Service for hosting Node.js web applications (SvelteKit with adapter-node, Express, Fastify, and similar). Covers deployment, scaling, authentication, networking, diagnostics, and operational concerns.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #5, #7, #8, #9, #10, #13
- **Preamble:** Azure App Service is a managed PaaS hosting layer. It handles TLS termination, identity, health probing, deployment orchestration, scaling, and networking — your application handles business logic and its own internal state. The line between what the platform owns and what your code owns is sharp, well-documented, and routinely crossed by applications that don't know where it is. This pairing maps the principles onto that boundary.

### `azure-fleet-control-plane`

- **Title:** Azure Fleet Control Plane (Multi-Tenant Resource-Group Access)
- **Pairs with:** Building an **external control plane that reads across a fleet of isolated, per-tenant Azure resource groups** — one resource group per customer instance, each its own blast radius (own VNet, no peering, private data plane), observed from a single control-plane app that sits *outside* every instance. Covers how that control plane **discovers, reaches into, and reads** each instance's resource group: the coordinate source (a metadata registry vs. live ARM/Resource-Graph discovery), the identity/RBAC *reach* into N resource groups, programmatic Azure Monitor / ARM access via a managed identity, and per-resource-group independent degradation. This is the **fleet read-access** axis — distinct from standing the footprint up (`azure-infra`, `terraform`), hosting one app (`azure-app-service`), and single-subscription CLI reporting (`azure-resource-management`). Where `azure-resource-management` reports on *one* subscription via `az`, this owns a *control plane* reaching programmatically into *many* isolated resource groups it provisioned.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7, #9, #10, #13
- **Preamble:** A fleet control plane has one defining property that drives every principle below: **the resource group is simultaneously the isolation unit and the access unit.** The same per-instance resource group that makes one customer's outage structurally unable to touch another's (no peering, private endpoints, own RBAC scope) is *also* the boundary the control plane must reach across to read N instances at once — and it must do so without ever becoming a route *between* instances or a data path *into* one. The control plane therefore reads each resource group on its own identity, on its own coordinate, with its own independent failure — and the whole skill is keeping "how I find the resource group," "how I'm allowed to reach it," and "what I read from it" on three separate axes, while being honest that "I can see the fleet" only ever means the union of the resource groups my identity is actually granted and the metrics each one actually emits.

### `azure-infra`

- **Title:** Azure Infrastructure (Provisioning Architecture)
- **Pairs with:** Architecting **declarative Azure infrastructure** — Container Apps (and Container Apps Environments), managed identity, Key Vault references, private endpoints / VNet isolation, ACR, AAD-auth'd storage backends. The **"how the resources are shaped, identified, secured, and isolated"** side of Azure — independent of the IaC tool that applies them (`terraform`, Bicep, ARM) and independent of the read/report (`azure-resource-management`), classic-host/deploy (`azure-app-service`), identity-provider (`entra-id`), and M365 (`microsoft-graph`) surfaces. Where those cover *talking to* Azure, this covers *standing up* a secure, isolated, identity-first Azure footprint.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7, #9, #10, #11, #13
- **Preamble:** Azure's provisioning model has one property that drives every principle below: **identity, secrets, and network are three separate planes that must be wired together, and the seams between them are where security and reliability are won or lost.** A managed identity is useless without a role assignment; a role assignment is useless until it propagates; a Key Vault reference is useless without the identity that reads it; a private endpoint silently breaks reachability if DNS isn't wired. The platform gives you primitives that *compose into* a secure footprint — but it does not enforce that you compose them correctly. This pairing is about keeping those three planes on their own axes and being honest about Azure's asynchronous, eventually-consistent control plane.

### `azure-resource-management`

- **Title:** Azure Resource Management (Query & Reporting)
- **Pairs with:** Reading from and reporting on an Azure environment via the Azure CLI (`az`) and the underlying ARM / Cost Management / Monitor APIs — resource enumeration, cost/billing retrieval, and performance metrics. The **read/control-plane reporting** side of Azure: "what do I have, what does it cost, how is it performing," not deploying or hosting. Complements rather than overlaps the deployment-hosting (App Service), identity (Entra ID), and M365 (Graph) surfaces.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7, #9, #10, #13
- **Preamble:** "Azure" is not one API. A tool that reports on a subscription is talking to at least three distinct backends — the **ARM control plane** (what resources exist), **Cost Management** (what they cost), and **Azure Monitor** (how they perform) — each with its own data model, latency, consistency guarantees, and quirks. The Azure CLI papers them over into one `az` command surface, which is convenient and a trap: the uniform front hides per-service differences that decide correctness. The principles below specialize for keeping those three engines on separate axes and being honest about what each one can and cannot tell you.

### `c`

- **Title:** C
- **Pairs with:** The C language (C11/C17/C23 — C23 published as ISO/IEC 9899:2024, default in GCC 15+; freestanding or hosted)
- **Touches principles:** #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** C gives you exactly the rope you ask for. Most of the discipline that other languages provide via type systems or runtimes, C requires you to provide via convention. The principles below show where C demands explicit choices to maintain orthogonality.

### `cloud-pentest-azure`

- **Title:** Cloud Pentest (Azure)
- **Pairs with:** Azure cloud configuration and secrets attack testing (skill / domain) — testing the deployment substrate beneath an application: platform authentication boundaries, secret exposure, managed-identity and service-principal blast radius, over-privileged credentials, and container / supply-chain exposure. Assumes an authorized context with explicit cloud scope.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #7, #9, #10, #13
- **Preamble:** An application's real trust boundary includes the cloud it runs in: the platform feature that fronts it, the environment that holds its secrets, and the identity it uses to call other services. Application code routinely assumes that substrate is safe — that the platform auth layer can't be bypassed, that environment variables are private, that the service principal it authenticates with is narrowly scoped. Cloud configuration testing checks those assumptions. The principles below specialize for the deployment trust edges rather than the application's request surface.

### `copy-truth`

- **Title:** Copy Truth
- **Pairs with:** user-facing instructional text as a verification surface — every helper line, tooltip, placeholder, empty state, confirmation prompt, error message, badge title, and onboarding hint a product shows its users. Each one is a *claim about behavior*, and this pairing treats the full set as an auditable contract: instruction must match function. Covers the truthfulness and synchronization of in-product copy. Out of scope: visual presentation of text (a perceptual concern), vocabulary architecture (which words name which concepts — a mental-model concern), and developer-facing comments/docs (covered by code-level doc-drift discipline).
- **Touches principles:** #2, #7, #9, #12, #13
- **Preamble:** Instructional copy is the one part of the system users actually read, and the one part no compiler checks. A tooltip that says "never invoiced" while the engine invoices anyway isn't a typo — it's a false statement of behavior delivered at the exact moment of a decision, with the product's full authority behind it. Code that drifts from comments wastes developers' time; copy that drifts from function makes *users* wrong, and they have no way to debug the discrepancy. The discipline: every instructional string is a claim; claims get verified against the code path they describe, and re-verified when that path changes.

### `css`

- **Title:** CSS
- **Pairs with:** CSS the language — selectors, cascade, layout, typography, color, motion, custom properties, modern modules (cascade layers, container queries, `:has()`, nesting, view transitions, color spaces, `@property`, scope). Framework-agnostic; applies whether the surface is vanilla CSS, CSS modules, Svelte scoped styles, Tailwind, or any combination.
- **Touches principles:** #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10
- **Preamble:** CSS has been doing more for fewer lines every year. The post-2022 baseline — cascade layers, container queries, `:has()`, native nesting, OKLCH, view transitions, `@property`, `@scope` — has changed what "modern CSS" means more in three years than the prior decade. The principles below specialize the design rules for CSS's specific texture: a declarative cascade where order, specificity, and scope all decide who wins, and where the same visual result can be produced by very different cascade strategies.

### `display-manager`

- **Title:** Display Manager (Wayland login)
- **Pairs with:** The login-manager / display-manager layer on Linux — `greetd` (+ `ReGreet`/`gtkgreet`/`tuigreet`), and the same reasoning applies to SDDM, GDM, `plasma-login-manager`, and `ly`. Applies to any project that *configures, themes, or switches* the program that owns the pre-session screen: the greeter, the `greeter`/`plasmalogin`/`sddm` system user, the VT/seat it claims, and the handoff into the chosen session.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7, #9, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** A display manager is the one program that runs **before there is a user session** and decides which session begins. That single fact dominates the domain: the greeter executes as an unprivileged *system* user (`greeter`, `sddm`, `plasmalogin`) with no access to any human's `$HOME`, no running session bus of its own to inherit theme from, and sole ownership of a VT and a seat. It is also the component with the **worst failure mode in the stack** — a broken greeter config doesn't degrade gracefully, it locks you out of the GUI entirely, and there is no windowed preview to test against. The principles below specialize for those two facts: the greeter is a sandbox that must carry its own assets, and the only real test is the switch itself, so reversibility is a design requirement, not a nicety.

### `e2e`

- **Title:** End-to-End Testing
- **Pairs with:** End-to-end (system / acceptance) testing — verifying a whole system through the same surface a real user touches (methodology)
- **Touches principles:** #1, #4, #5, #6, #7, #9, #10, #12, #13
- **Preamble:** An end-to-end test makes one promise: *a real user, on the assembled system, can do this and see the right result.* The promise is only kept if the test exercises the system **through the surface the user actually touches** and asserts **the outcome the user can actually observe**. Every failure mode in this domain is a way that promise quietly breaks while the bar stays green — a test that drives a mock instead of the system, that asserts a `data-testid` exists instead of that the value is right, that checks a 200 instead of the rendered total, that passes because it asserted nothing at all. The discipline of e2e is not "click through the app"; it is **refusing the proxy** — assert the thing the user sees, in the integrated system, or admit you didn't test it. A green e2e suite that asserts proxies is the most expensive lie in a codebase, because it buys false confidence at the exact layer where confidence is supposed to be earned.

### `electronics`

- **Title:** Electronics
- **Pairs with:** Analog and digital circuit design — component selection, schematic capture, PCB layout, bring-up.
- **Touches principles:** #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** Hardware is physics with deadlines. Most failures in the field trace to assumptions that worked on the bench under nominal conditions and broke under voltage, temperature, EMI, or aging. The principles below specialize for designing circuits that survive contact with the real world.

### `entra-id`

- **Title:** Microsoft Entra ID
- **Pairs with:** Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) — identity platform for OIDC/OAuth2 authentication, authorization, directory services, and Microsoft Graph API access. Covers app registrations, token flows, RBAC, service principals, managed identities, and conditional access.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #12, #13
- **Preamble:** Entra ID is three systems wearing one trenchcoat: an identity provider (OIDC tokens), an authorization engine (app roles, group claims, conditional access), and a directory service (Graph API). Most integration bugs come from treating it as one thing. The principles below are about keeping those axes separate, anticipating the full state space of token-based auth, and being honest about what Entra ID does and does not guarantee.

### `esp-idf`

- **Title:** ESP-IDF
- **Pairs with:** ESP-IDF (Espressif IoT Development Framework) for ESP32-family microcontrollers. Current line is v5.x (long-term) and v6.x (latest stable as of mid-2026). Targets the full ESP32 family: original ESP32 / S2 / S3 (Xtensa) and C2 / C3 / C5 / C6 / C61 / H2 / H4 / P4 (RISC-V).
- **Touches principles:** #3, #4, #6, #7, #8, #11, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** ESP-IDF is opinionated infrastructure on top of FreeRTOS and a C SDK. Most of its idioms exist because microcontrollers have constraints desktop code doesn't — limited RAM, no MMU, interrupts you must service, tasks competing for cycles. The principles below specialize for those constraints.

### `field-service-orchestration`

- **Title:** Field Service Orchestration
- **Pairs with:** Software that runs the path from an inbound service request to a completed on-site visit and beyond. Covers intake (phone, web form, SMS, email, returning-customer portal, EDI), triage and qualification, scheduling and dispatch, technician assignment, en-route tracking, on-site execution, completion / closeout, post-visit follow-up, and the **communications fabric** that touches every actor (customer ↔ dispatcher ↔ technician ↔ supervisor ↔ back office) at every stage. Industry-agnostic — trades (HVAC, plumbing, electrical), IT field services / MSP, healthcare home visits, courier and light delivery, locksmiths, appliance repair, property management.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** Field-service work is operational software with a body in motion. Unlike pure-digital order pipelines, a job here ends in a human being arriving at a physical address, doing skilled work in conditions nobody fully knows in advance, and leaving with a billable result the customer can dispute. Three things connect the stages: a **lifecycle state machine** that's enforceable end-to-end, a **communications fabric** that keeps every actor aligned without becoming a side-channel for state, and an **audit trail** of who said what and when. The principles below specialize for keeping these three on **orthogonal axes** while keeping the invariants (one source of truth per actor's status, every commitment to a customer is on-the-record, every state change is attributable) intact under the conditions field work actually runs in — partial connectivity, missed appointments, parts shortages, customer not home, and exceptions running 20–30% of the day's jobs.

### `freertos`

- **Title:** FreeRTOS
- **Pairs with:** FreeRTOS — Real-Time Operating System kernel for microcontrollers. Versions ≥ v10 targeted, with v11.x (the upstream-SMP line; current is V11.3.0, March 2026) as the canonical reference; vendor variants (ESP-IDF FreeRTOS with its earlier Espressif SMP extension, Zephyr's compat layer, etc.) inherit most guidance but diverge in specific extensions. The FreeRTOS LTS releases (202xxx.xx versioning, latest 202604 LTS at time of writing) are the stable-API choice for long-running production.
- **Touches principles:** #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #13
- **Preamble:** FreeRTOS is a kernel, not a framework. It gives you tasks, queues, timers, mutexes, semaphores, event groups, and stream/message buffers — and nothing else. Drivers, networking, file systems, and application logic are all supplied by you. The principles below are about getting the kernel's primitives to express the project's concurrency model cleanly, rather than letting concurrency leak through every module as ad-hoc shared state and ad-hoc priority choices.

### `gpu-performance`

- **Title:** GPU Performance (Linux desktop)
- **Pairs with:** GPU acceleration and desktop responsiveness tuning on Linux — Mesa drivers, the Wayland/KWin compositing path, kernel DRM (`i915`/`xe`, `amdgpu`), and power/thermal trade-offs. Calibrated on Intel Iris Xe / Tiger Lake (the laptop-iGPU case); the reasoning generalizes to any Mesa-on-Wayland desktop. Applies whenever the goal is *measurable* snappiness, not more eye candy.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #9, #13, #16
- **Preamble:** GPU/perf work is where vibes go to lie. "It feels faster" is the single most expensive sentence in the domain — it justifies changes that do nothing, re-open side channels, or trade battery for a frame nobody sees. The principles below specialize for one discipline: **a perf change is a claim, and a claim needs a number, a case-space, and an honest bound.** On an integrated GPU especially, the binding constraint is usually memory bandwidth, thermals, and the compositor's always-on cost — not raw shader throughput — so the tuning that matters is rarely the tuning that's exciting.

### `hyprland`

- **Title:** Hyprland (wlroots compositor + layer-shell)
- **Pairs with:** Configuring Hyprland — both as a full desktop session and as a minimal greeter/kiosk compositor — and the `wlr-layer-shell` surfaces that live on it (wallpapers, bars, launchers, lock screens, greeters). Calibrated on Hyprland; the reasoning is `wlroots`-general and carries to Sway, river, and Wayfire (the config *syntax* differs, the layer-shell *model* is identical). Sits beside `kde-plasma` (which owns the KWin/Plasma compositing path) and applies whenever the compositor is *not* KWin.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #13
- **Preamble:** Hyprland (and any wlroots compositor) is a **bare drawing engine with no opinions**: unlike Plasma/KWin it ships no desktop, no panel, no settings daemon, no theme cascade — it draws windows and runs the programs you tell it to via `exec-once`, and everything else (wallpaper, bar, notifications, idle, lock) is a *separate* layer-shell client you compose on top. Two facts dominate: the desktop is an assembly of independent surfaces with explicit *layer roles* (background / bottom / top / overlay) rather than one integrated shell, and the config is plain declarative text read once at launch — what it can do is fixed by the engine, and the config only sequences it. The principles below specialize for composing those surfaces correctly and for not assuming any of KWin's batteries-included behavior is present.

### `identity-pentest`

- **Title:** Identity Pentest
- **Pairs with:** Authentication and authorization attack testing (skill / domain) — testing identity trust boundaries: token, claim, and header trust; session handling; role-based access control enforcement; privilege boundaries; and shared-secret-protected endpoints. Assumes an authorized context.
- **Touches principles:** #4, #5, #7, #12, #13
- **Preamble:** An authentication system is a stack of trust claims: *this header came from the platform, this token is one we issued, this role grants this action.* Identity testing attacks each claim at the point where it is trusted but not actually verified. The most dangerous bugs live where the application trusts an upstream component — a reverse proxy, a platform authentication layer, an injected header — that an attacker can sometimes reach around or speak to directly. The principles below specialize for finding the gap between "trusted" and "verified."

### `injection-pentest`

- **Title:** Injection Pentest
- **Pairs with:** Injection and data-layer attack testing (skill / domain) — SQL injection, ORM-misuse injection, and other untrusted-data-into-interpreter flaws in the persistence and data-handling layer. Assumes an authorized context.
- **Touches principles:** #4, #6, #7, #13
- **Preamble:** Injection is what happens when data crosses into an interpreter without a boundary between "this is content" and "this is code." A modern data-access layer (an ORM, a query builder, parameterized statements) promises that boundary by default — which is exactly why injection testing focuses on the seams where a developer stepped *outside* the default: raw query fragments, dynamically chosen identifiers, string-built clauses, and data that was stored safely but later re-used unsafely. The principles below specialize for finding those seams.

### `interaction-design`

- **Title:** Interaction Design
- **Pairs with:** The behavior layer of interface work — what the system *does* over time when the user acts. Direct manipulation, feedback loops and their timing budgets, microinteractions (triggers, rules, feedback, modes/loops), gesture and modality, state coverage across an interaction's life (idle → triggered → active → resolved / aborted / errored), error prevention and recovery, animation as communication (not decoration), reversibility, and the laws of motor and decision time (Fitts, Hick, Tesler, Doherty). Out of scope: the cognitive layer (mental-model formation, signifiers, learnability) and the architectural-visual layer (structure, hierarchy, typography, design systems).
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #13
- **Preamble:** An interaction is not a moment, it's a small life: the user tries something, the system responds, the user adjusts, the system responds again. Each step has timing, has state, has the possibility of failure, and contributes to whether the interaction feels alive or feels broken. This pairing is about designing that life as a deliberate engine — every interaction's full state-space, the feedback the user receives at each transition, the timing budgets the system honors, and the recovery paths when something goes wrong. The behavior-over-time axis is where the user actually touches the system; many interfaces that look fine at rest fall apart in motion because this layer was not designed deliberately.

### `ios`

- **Title:** iOS
- **Pairs with:** native iOS development — Swift, SwiftUI (UIKit where it still owns the job), the scene/app lifecycle, Swift structured concurrency (actors, `@MainActor`, Sendable), state ownership in a value-semantics world, background execution under iOS's strict budget, APNs push, the permission/privacy model, and memory pressure (jetsam). Covers the platform layer: how iOS's execution model and Apple's review/privacy regime shape design. Out of scope: cross-platform wrappers, App Store release operations and ASO, and visual design language (the HIG is referenced only where it is architecture — navigation idiom, Dynamic Type, safe areas).
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #13
- **Preamble:** iOS's defining fact is **scarcity enforced from above**: background time is a budget measured in seconds, memory is reclaimed by killing you without a crash log a user can see (jetsam), the only reliable wake-up from outside is a push, and capabilities ship gated behind a permission and review regime that treats every access as a privacy claim. Where Android's process is a guest, iOS's is a guest on a timer. Designs that assume "the app will get a chance to finish this later" are wrong by construction — the platform's answer is *persist now, reconcile on next foreground*, and most of this pairing is that answer applied per principle.

### `jobs-to-be-done`

- **Title:** Jobs to Be Done
- **Pairs with:** Product and feature work seen through the *user's lived perspective* — the jobs-to-be-done lens and its companions (personas, goal-directed design, mental models). A reasoning discipline for *which feature, and for whom*, not a UI surface-design method.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #6, #7, #10, #12
- **Preamble:** A feature is never the thing the user wants; it is the mechanism you hope serves the thing they want. The job-to-be-done lens forces a slowdown before any mechanism gets built: a product is *hired* to make **progress in a circumstance**, so the design starts from the **job and the person's lived context** — who they are, what progress they are reaching for, and what a domain word means *to them* — not from the feature you were about to ship. The discipline's sharpest single move is naming **who** the user is (including the user who wears **two roles at once**) and then watching for a **domain word that means two different things** to that user: an overloaded term is the tell that two jobs — or two roles — have been quietly collapsed onto one axis. The principles below show where that lens already lives in this collection, and where reasoning from the user's side catches an axis you cannot see from the feature's side.

### `kde-plasma`

- **Title:** KDE Plasma
- **Pairs with:** The KDE Plasma 6 desktop (Wayland-first) and its configuration substrate — KConfig (`kdeglobals`, `*rc` files), kded modules, KWin, and the `plasma-apply-*` / `kwriteconfig6` tooling. Applies to any project that *configures or extends* a Plasma desktop declaratively.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9
- **Preamble:** Plasma's configuration is a **cascade of `INI`-shaped KConfig files** read live by long-running daemons (kded, KWin, plasmashell), not a static dotfile read once at login. Two facts dominate: a setting can be written three ways (a file, `kwriteconfig6`, or a `plasma-apply-*` helper) with different reload semantics, and almost everything is *layered* — system defaults under `/usr`, user overrides under `~/.config`, with immutability flags and `[$i]` markers in between. Get the layer and the reload right and Plasma is wonderfully scriptable; get them wrong and your change is either ignored, shadowed, or clobbered on next login.

### `laravel`

- **Title:** Laravel
- **Pairs with:** The Laravel framework (versions 9.x and later, through Laravel 13.x — current stable since March 2026; 13.6.0 at time of writing). Applies to any project where Laravel is the application framework — web apps, APIs, CLI tools built on Artisan, queue-driven workers. Note: Laravel has not shipped an LTS major since Laravel 6 (2019); the support window is 18 months bug-fix + 2 years security per release.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #11, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** Laravel is a sequencer wrapped around a set of engines: the IoC container, the request lifecycle, Eloquent's query builder, the database schema engine, the queue worker, the scheduler, Blade. Each engine has a well-defined range; the framework's job is to make those engines easy to reach from a thin instruction layer (routes, controllers, jobs, commands). The principles below specialize for keeping that separation honest — controllers stay thin, engines stay engines, and the framework's conveniences don't become the project's load-bearing architecture.

### `layout-resilience`

- **Title:** Layout Resilience
- **Pairs with:** layout as an engineering surface — whether a composition survives *real content* at *every viewport*: overflow and wrapping mechanics (flex/grid shrink rules, truncation that actually truncates), choosing the right display form (table / list row / card / grid) for the data and the task, breakpoint coherence, and density appropriateness. Covers the mechanical robustness and form-selection layer of layout. Out of scope: visual hierarchy and perception (a perceptual concern), design-system token consistency (a structural concern), and interaction states (a behavioral concern). This is the layer those lenses each assume is already working: that the boxes themselves hold.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #6, #9, #13
- **Preamble:** Layouts fail emergently: the markup looks fine, the demo content fits, and then a real customer is named "Cellco Partnership DBA Verizon Wireless – IL" on a 390px screen and the buttons leave the card. No single class is wrong — the *composition* is wrong, and only under content × viewport combinations nobody rendered. Audits that read markup for class-level signals (contrast ratios, missing labels) sail past this, because resilience isn't a property of any one element; it's a property of how a container negotiates with unknown content. This pairing makes that negotiation auditable: the failure patterns are finite, greppable, and fixable by construction.

### `led-display`

- **Title:** LED Display
- **Pairs with:** Driving LED displays (addressable strips, matrix panels, multiplexed arrays) as a graphics **output target** — putting a prepared frame onto the pixels faithfully: wire protocol, color depth, perceptual encoding, channel order, and the visual artifacts that are specific to LEDs.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** LEDs are quantized light sources with a nonlinear perceptual response and protocol-timed addressing — qualities a file-format renderer never faces. This pairing covers putting a *prepared* frame onto LED pixels so it looks the way it was meant to: the wire protocol, color depth and perceptual encoding, channel order, and the visual artifacts (flicker, banding, color drift) specific to LEDs. Two adjacent concerns are deliberately out of scope: **powering** the array (current, supply, thermal) is an electrical problem, and the **bus/DMA mechanism** that clocks the bitstream out is a firmware problem. This pairing assumes a frame exists and a transport exists; its job is that the frame is *encoded and addressed* faithfully.

### `local-trade-marketing`

- **Title:** Local Trade Marketing
- **Pairs with:** Marketing a **local, trust-dependent trade or services business** — a locksmith, alarm/security installer, safe dealer, electrician, plumber, HVAC, roofer, or similar. The buyer is choosing someone to come into their home or business and be trusted with their safety, money, or property; the purchase is high-consideration, locally bounded, and won on credibility rather than price or novelty. This is the *demand-side* discipline — positioning, audience segmentation, proof, local discoverability, and lead conversion. Out of scope: the visual presentation of the site (a UI concern), the truthfulness mechanics of individual strings (a copy-discipline concern), and the product/feature-selection lens (a jobs-to-be-done concern).
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #9, #10, #12, #13
- **Preamble:** A local trade business does not win the way a SaaS product or a national brand wins. The prospect has a *circumstance* — a break-in down the street, a lockout, a new building to secure, a safe to move — and is looking, locally and often urgently, for someone competent and trustworthy. They cannot inspect the work before buying, so they buy **signals of credibility**: years in business, real credentials and manufacturer authorizations, a real address and phone, a recognizable local name, and proof that real neighbors trust them. Marketing here is the disciplined assembly of *true* signals into a path that ends in a call or a quote request. The discipline's spine: every persuasive claim is a credibility claim, every credibility claim must be real and verifiable, and the whole funnel is judged by leads, not applause.

### `mental-models`

- **Title:** Mental Models
- **Pairs with:** The cognitive layer of interface work — how users form a working theory of "what this system is and how it behaves," and how the interface either supports or breaks that theory. Norman's three-model framework (designer's conceptual model, the system image emitted by the interface, the user's mental model assembled from the system image plus prior experience), affordances and signifiers, metaphor and analogy, recognition vs. recall, cognitive load, learnability, onboarding as initial model formation, discoverability. "Intuitive" reduced to its useful operational definition: the user's mental model matches the system's actual behavior closely enough that prediction succeeds.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #4, #5, #6, #8, #9, #13
- **Preamble:** A user doesn't reason about your system from a spec sheet. They build a working theory of it from whatever they can perceive — the labels, the layout, the responses to their actions, what changed when they did the last thing, what reminds them of something else they already know. That working theory is the mental model, and every prediction the user makes about your system runs through it. When their model matches your system's actual behavior, the experience feels intuitive; when it diverges, the experience feels broken — *even when the system is working exactly as designed*.

### `microsoft-graph`

- **Title:** Microsoft Graph API
- **Pairs with:** Microsoft Graph API — the unified REST API surface for Microsoft 365 services (Entra ID, Outlook mail/calendar, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, Planner, users, groups). Covers v1.0 and beta endpoints, Microsoft Graph SDKs, and the authentication/authorization model via Microsoft Identity Platform (MSAL).
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #5, #7, #8, #9
- **Preamble:** Microsoft Graph is a single endpoint (`https://graph.microsoft.com`) that federates dozens of backend services, each with its own consistency model, throttling behavior, and permission granularity. The principles below address the fact that "one API" is a convenient lie — the unified surface hides per-service differences that matter for correctness, performance, and authorization. Treating Graph as uniform invites the kind of reactive patching Principle 2 warns against.

### `midi-cv`

- **Title:** MIDI / CV / Sync
- **Pairs with:** MIDI 1.0 and 2.0 protocols, analog CV/Gate, and hardware sync standards (DIN Sync 24, Korg sync, Pocket Operator sync, MTC). Applies to any project that sends or receives time-critical musical control signals between hardware devices.
- **Touches principles:** #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9
- **Preamble:** MIDI and CV are deceptively simple at the surface and unforgiving at the edges. Note On / Note Off is a one-page concept; running-status optimization, RPN/NRPN parameter trees, SysEx negotiation, MTC quarter-frame messages, MIDI 2.0 UMP packets, and the dance of multiple devices sharing one cable are not. Analog CV looks even simpler — a voltage and a gate — but voltage standards (1V/oct vs. Hz/V vs. Buchla 1.2V/oct), calibration drift, gate level conventions, and sync-pulse standards all hide here. The principles below are about respecting that gap.

### `monorepo`

- **Title:** Monorepo
- **Pairs with:** Multi-package repositories sharing a single version-control root and a workspace-aware package manager (npm workspaces, pnpm workspaces, Yarn workspaces, Cargo workspaces, Go workspaces, Bazel, Nx, Turborepo, Rush). Applies regardless of language — the pairing is about boundary discipline between co-located packages, not about a specific tool.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #6, #7, #8, #11, #14
- **Preamble:** A monorepo bundles multiple packages into one repository. The bundling buys atomic cross-package changes, shared tooling, and discoverability — but it also lets every package's internals become every other package's dependency unless boundaries are kept explicit. The principles below are about preserving package-level orthogonality without losing the bundling's value.

### `music-theory`

- **Title:** Music Theory
- **Pairs with:** Music theory as a body of domain knowledge — pitches, intervals, scales, modes, harmony, voice leading, rhythm, meter, form. Applies to any project that generates, analyzes, transforms, or reasons about musical material.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #4, #5, #6, #8, #9
- **Preamble:** Music theory is unusually well-suited to software because it is, at root, a system of rules about discrete objects (pitches, intervals, durations) under operations (transposition, inversion, retrograde, modulation). It is also unusually treacherous: every rule in the common-practice tradition has well-cited exceptions, every "consonance" depends on cultural and stylistic context, and "musical" is not a property the rules can fully predict. The principles below are about staying honest with that gap — building engines that capture what theory describes crisply, sequencing them as instructions for specific styles, and never claiming the engine produces "musicality" when it produces well-formed sequences.

### `network-sync`

- **Title:** Network Sync (Ableton Link, LTC/MTC, OSC, ArtNet, PTP)
- **Pairs with:** Software that keeps two or more independent devices in coherent musical or media time across a network or wire. Covers Ableton Link (peer-to-peer tempo/beat over UDP + mDNS), SMPTE Linear Timecode (LTC over an audio line), MIDI Time Code (MTC quarter-frame and full-frame over MIDI), Open Sound Control time-tagged bundles, ArtNet TimeCode and ArtSync (for lighting consoles), and the underlying NTP / PTP (IEEE 1588) clock infrastructure these protocols ride on. Applies to DAW companions, performance instruments, lighting rigs, multi-machine installations, generative-art systems, and any device that must agree with peers on "what time is it, musically."
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10
- **Preamble:** Distributed musical timing looks like a transport problem and is actually a clock problem. The hard part is not "send a beat over the wire"; it's that every participating device has its own oscillator drifting at its own rate, its own audio (or render) buffer adding its own latency, its own network path with its own jitter, and its own idea of what "now" means. A correct design starts by separating the clock domains — wall clock, audio clock, beat clock, frame clock — and refuses to confuse them. Ableton Link is the most rigorous live protocol in the space because it is peer-to-peer (no single master to lose), it exposes phase (not just tempo), and it solves the consensus problem deterministically across joins, leaves, and partitions. LTC / MTC / SMPTE are the answers when video is the anchor and timecode is the contract. OSC time-tagged bundles and ArtNet TimeCode are the answers when timing must drive non-audio targets (lighting, generative visuals, robotics). The principles below are about respecting the gap between "sending timing information" and "achieving timing coherence."

### `node-graph-ui`

- **Title:** Node-Graph UI
- **Pairs with:** Node-graph / patching interfaces — environments where the
- **Touches principles:** #1, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8
- **Preamble:** > **DRAFT — co-authoring required.** Per `pairings/README.md`, pairings are > co-authored with the domain owner, not auto-generated. This draft is > assembled from documented prior art (Bitwig Grid, Reaktor, Max/Pd, VCV > Rack). The principle *mappings* are the author's; the **domain claims** > (what's idiomatic, what users expect on open, what counts as a violation) > need your conviction over them — you're building the real thing in LEDws. > Strike, sharpen, or overrule anything below before this is committed.

### `notation-design`

- **Title:** Notation Design
- **Pairs with:** The design of **composable visual notations** — block / box-and-wire / dataflow authoring surfaces where a user assembles a result from named primitive pieces (visual programming languages, node editors, modular-synth and pedalboard signal chains, spreadsheet-like grids, block languages). The discipline of making a *notation* legible: can a newcomer read what a piece is, see how pieces combine, predict the result, and assemble without producing nonsense. "Intuitive" reduced to its operational test for notations: the visible structure of the notation matches the structure of the thing being built, so reading the layout *is* understanding the program. Out of scope: the rendered artifact's own visual design (that's the domain the notation produces), and general screen/layout/typography craft.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #13
- **Preamble:** A notation is not the program; it is the *clothing* the program wears so a human can read and edit it. The same engine can wear a notation that reads like assembly or one that reads like a recipe. The Cognitive Dimensions framework names the independent axes along which a notation succeeds or fails — and crucially, they are *trade-offs*, not a checklist to max out: tightening one (say, error-proofing) usually loosens another (say, freedom of expression). Design is choosing where on each axis this notation should sit, given who reads it. The cardinal sin, and the one that makes a composable system feel incomprehensible, is the **hidden dependency**: a piece silently relies on something not visible in the notation, so the layout lies about how the thing actually works.

### `offensive-security`

- **Title:** Offensive Security
- **Pairs with:** Authorized penetration testing and offensive security engagements (methodology) — rules of engagement, scoping, threat modeling, evidence handling, proof-of-concept discipline, severity rating, and reporting. Assumes a legitimate, authorized context (signed engagement, CTF, internal assessment of a system you own or are permitted to test).
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #9, #10, #11, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** Offensive testing is design discipline pointed backwards. You reason about a system's trust boundaries the way its builder should have — except your output is not the system, it's a verified account of where its claims break. Three things make this a methodology rather than ad-hoc poking: the rules of engagement are the scope contract, the proof-of-concept is the demonstrability gate, and the report is the durable artifact. The principles below are about keeping those honest under the pressure to find more, find it faster, and overstate what was found.

### `ordering-logistics-reporting`

- **Title:** Ordering, Logistics, and Reporting
- **Pairs with:** Operational business software — order entry and lifecycle, inventory and stock movement, scheduling and fulfillment (pickup / delivery / shipping), and the reports and dashboards built on top. Applies regardless of vertical (food service, retail, light manufacturing, B2B distribution) and regardless of storefront (phone-in, in-person, web, EDI).
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** Operational software runs the business: every order taken, every item moved, every report a stakeholder reads to decide what to do tomorrow. The three concerns are inseparable — orders mutate inventory and fulfillment commitments; logistics consumes those commitments and produces actuals; reports project the whole history into decisions. The principles below specialize for keeping these three on **orthogonal axes** while preserving the invariants that connect them (inventory conservation, time ordering, monetary reconciliation).

### `php`

- **Title:** PHP
- **Pairs with:** PHP, the language (versions 8.0+; 8.5 is the current stable as of late 2025 / early 2026, adding the pipe operator `|>`, clone-with, and `array_first`/`array_last`). Applies to any project where PHP is the authored language — framework code, library code, scripts, CLI tools.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #13
- **Preamble:** PHP grew up as a templating language with a stdlib bolted on, then spent two decades growing a real type system, real OOP, real error handling, and real package management on top of the same runtime. The result is a language with two coexisting dialects: the loose, weakly-typed, request-scoped scripting language of the 2000s, and the strict, typed, contract-oriented language of 2026. The principles below assume the modern dialect — strict types, exceptions over return-code errors, declared shapes over array bags — and treat the older dialect as a hazard to navigate around when touching legacy code.

### `plasma-theming`

- **Title:** Plasma Theming (Kvantum + Qt/KDE + GTK fallback)
- **Pairs with:** Building a *cohesive, toolkit-spanning* desktop theme on Plasma — the full System Settings → Appearance surface (color scheme, Plasma Style, Application Style, Window Decoration, icons, cursors, splash) across Qt-native, Kvantum-styled Qt, and GTK applications, with day/night awareness. Sits below `kde-plasma` (mechanism) and applies whenever the deliverable is *the look*.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10
- **Preamble:** A Linux desktop has no single styling authority — it has *toolkits*, each with its own theming engine, that you must coax into agreement. Qt apps follow KColorScheme + a widget style (Breeze or Kvantum); GTK apps follow their own GTK theme; Chromium/Electron follow almost nothing. "Theming Plasma" is really *making N independent rendering stacks agree on one palette and read consistent in both light and dark*. The principles below specialize for that coordination problem: one source of color truth, fanned out to each toolkit through the bridge it actually reads, with the toolkits nobody can fully reach named honestly.

### `playwright`

- **Title:** Playwright
- **Pairs with:** Playwright — the browser-automation / end-to-end test runner (tool / skill)
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #5, #7, #9, #12, #13
- **Preamble:** Playwright is the engine that drives a real browser as a user would and observes what the browser actually renders. Used well, it closes the exact gap that lets a test suite stay green while the UI is broken — because its native idioms (user-facing locators, web-first retrying assertions, traces) are built to assert *the user's observable reality* rather than the DOM's internal shape. Used carelessly, it reproduces every false-green in a faster, more confident-looking wrapper: a `waitForTimeout` that hides a race, a CSS-selector locator coupled to markup, a `toBeVisible()` taken as proof the layout is right. The tool's defaults pull toward honesty; the failures come from fighting them.

### `postgres`

- **Title:** PostgreSQL
- **Pairs with:** PostgreSQL (versions 14–17) as the relational database in application projects. Covers schema design, query patterns, indexing, migrations, transactions, JSONB, full-text search, connection management, and operational concerns. Includes Drizzle ORM conventions where relevant, as a common TypeScript schema-definition and query layer.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** PostgreSQL is a full engine in the principles' sense — it owns ACID transactions, concurrency control, constraint enforcement, indexing, and query planning. The schema is the vision artifact: it declares what data exists, how it relates, and what invariants hold. Getting the schema right is vision work (#1); everything downstream — queries, indexes, migrations — sequences that engine's capabilities (#5). Most Postgres problems in application code stem from treating the database as a dumb store rather than engaging the engine's actual range.

### `powershell`

- **Title:** PowerShell & Windows Automation Scripting
- **Pairs with:** PowerShell as an automation language — Windows PowerShell 5.1 (the in-box, .NET-Framework-bound version that ships in WinPE and every Windows install) and PowerShell 7+ (pwsh, .NET, cross-platform) — plus its interop with classic `cmd`/batch and its behavior in constrained hosts (WinPE, Server Core, Constrained Language Mode). Covers writing robust, legible automation; not a specific framework.
- **Touches principles:** #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** PowerShell is two things at once: a shell (terse, interactive, native-command-friendly) and a .NET object pipeline (typed, structured, programmable). Most bad PowerShell comes from using one when the job wanted the other — parsing text out of an object stream, or building a brittle string when an object was right there. The principles below specialize for keeping the shell-convenience and the object-rigor on their proper axes, and for surviving the hostile hosts (WinPE, locked-down endpoints) where this language earns its keep.

### `processor-memory`

- **Title:** Processor & Memory
- **Pairs with:** CPU scheduling, threading, memory layout, cache, allocators, and performance optimization across user-space and kernel boundaries.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #7, #8, #9, #10, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** Performance is structural, not local. The biggest wins come from data layout, threading model, and allocation strategy — chosen before code exists, not patched in after. Profiling reveals where you are; choices made upfront determine where you can go. The principles below specialize for designing systems that meet a performance budget by construction.

### `prose-craft`

- **Title:** Prose Craft
- **Pairs with:** any prose a human reads — emails, announcements, release notes, README and docs prose, marketing and landing copy, in-product paragraphs longer than a label, commit/PR descriptions, reports. The unit is the *sentence and the paragraph*, judged as English: grammar, mechanics, rhythm, structure, and readability. This pairing owns whether the writing is **well-formed and clear**, independent of whether its claims are **true** — that truthfulness axis belongs to `copy-truth`. A sentence can be true and unreadable (this pairing's job) or grammatical and false (copy-truth's job); the two are orthogonal and a good piece of writing passes both. Out of scope: truth of behavioral claims (copy-truth), the *visual* presentation of text — type, spacing, hierarchy (a perceptual concern), and which words *name product concepts* — vocabulary architecture (a mental-model concern).
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #6, #7, #8
- **Preamble:** Prose is the one artifact whose defects no linter catches and every reader feels. A clumsy sentence doesn't error — it just quietly costs the reader attention: a buried point, a pronoun with no antecedent, four bullets that start four different ways, a paragraph that makes the reader hold five clauses in their head to reach a verb. None of it is "wrong" the way a bug is wrong, so it ships. The discipline is to treat writing structurally — the same orthogonality, boundaries, and consistency the principles demand of code apply to clauses, sentences, and sections — and to revise against that structure, because first-draft prose is reactive-patched by default: each thought stapled to the one before it in the order it occurred to the writer, not the order the reader needs.

### `pwa`

- **Title:** Progressive Web Apps
- **Pairs with:** Progressive Web Apps — service workers, web app manifest, installability, offline patterns, cache management, push notifications, background sync, and mobile-first delivery.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #7, #9, #10, #13
- **Preamble:** A PWA sits between a website and a native app. The gap between those two things is where every hard decision lives: how much offline capability to promise, which platform APIs actually work, how aggressively to cache, how to handle updates when the user hasn't closed a tab in three weeks. The service worker is a powerful engine — it intercepts every network request — but it runs in a lifecycle the developer does not fully control, on platforms with wildly different support. The principles below keep that complexity from collapsing into hand-waved "it works offline" claims.

### `python`

- **Title:** Python
- **Pairs with:** Python the language (3.11–3.14; 3.14 is current stable — free-threaded builds officially supported per PEP 779, deferred annotation evaluation per PEP 649/749, t-strings per PEP 750). Applies to any project where Python is the primary authored language — libraries, CLIs, services, scripts, and data/automation glue.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #13
- **Preamble:** Python will let you write almost anything almost any way — that flexibility is the whole appeal and the whole hazard. The discipline other languages enforce through a compiler, Python defers to convention, tooling, and you. The principles below specialize for the places where Python's "it'll run" must be turned into "it's correct": typed boundaries, a real exception model, and the package structure that decides what's engine and what's caller.

### `raster-graphics`

- **Title:** Raster Graphics
- **Pairs with:** Producing intended visuals on 1D (linear pixel arrays) and 2D (pixel grids) raster surfaces — coordinate systems, framebuffers, rasterization, compositing, color synthesis, and animation craft, independent of the output device.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #6, #7, #8, #9, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** Raster graphics is the craft of turning intent into a grid of colored samples. The trap is that the pipeline has many points where the math and the perceived image diverge: compositing with straight alpha fringes edges, blending in gamma-encoded space muddies midtones, integer-only coordinates alias and stutter, and at low resolution a single pixel's position is load-bearing. The output is empirical — you judge it by looking, not by reading the code — so "the code is correct" and "the image is right" are different claims. Dimensionality is a coordinate choice, not a separate discipline: a 1D strip is a 1×N grid, and the same framebuffer → rasterizer → compositor → animator layering serves both.

### `realtime-graphics`

- **Title:** Real-Time Graphics
- **Pairs with:** The rendering layer of browser interfaces — the work of producing a correct, smooth frame every ~16ms across a wide range of hardware. requestAnimationFrame frame loops and the vsync clock; the browser compositor and its layer model; GPU paths (WebGL/WebGL2 fragment & vertex shaders, Canvas2D, CSS transform/opacity compositing); per-frame budgets; GPU context and resource lifecycle; capability detection and tiered graceful degradation (a workstation GPU down to a Raspberry-Pi-class SoC); and the measurement of smoothness itself. Out of scope: the *behavior* layer (what an interaction means over time — interaction-design), visual/typographic structure and hierarchy (ui-ux), and styling tokens/theming (css). This pairing is about pixels-per-frame, not meaning-per-action.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #5, #6, #7, #9, #13
- **Preamble:** A frame is a hard deadline that arrives sixty times a second and never slips. Everything in this domain is shaped by that fact: the renderer is an engine that must produce one finished, correct image inside a fixed budget, then do it again, forever, on hardware whose capability spans two orders of magnitude. "Smooth" is not an aesthetic — it is the measurable property that no frame missed its deadline. The failures here are specific and recurring: two animation loops that beat against each other, a clock that isn't the display's clock, a capability check that fires on noise, a GPU context that leaks until the browser refuses a new one, a "downgrade" that is permanent and trips on a transient. Designing the rendering engine deliberately — its clock, its budget, its degradation ladder, its resource lifecycle — is what separates butter from jank.

### `service-conformance`

- **Title:** Service Conformance
- **Pairs with:** Software whose job is to prove that what an organization **delivered** matches what it **committed** — and to surface the gap when it doesn't. The discipline is "say what you do, do what you say, prove it": a **commitment** side (obligations derived from a contract, SOW, service catalog, SLA, or internal policy — what was promised, by when, measured how), an **evidence** side (recorded actuals — attestations of what was actually done, with provenance), and a **reconciliation** that compares the two and names the drift. Industry-agnostic — MSP customer onboarding and managed-service delivery, professional-services SOW fulfillment, SLA/SLO conformance, internal QMS conformity (ISO-9001-style), vendor/supplier obligation tracking, any "did we actually do what we sold?" surface. This is **internal conformance** (delivery vs. promise), not external regulatory attestation to an outside authority — see #10.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #12, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** Conformance software lives between two records that are written by different people at different times for different reasons: the **promise** (written when the deal closed — a contract, a SOW, a service-catalog selection, an onboarding checklist someone agreed to) and the **delivery** (written as work happens — tickets closed, users provisioned, baselines applied, reviews performed). Its entire value is the **reconciliation** of those two records and the honest naming of where they disagree. That disagreement runs in *both directions*: "we promised X and there's no evidence we did it" (a delivery gap) and "we did Y but it maps to no promise / a different promise" (a recording or scope gap). Three things must stay on **orthogonal axes**: the **commitment register** (what we owe), the **evidence store** (what we can prove), and the **reconciliation engine** (the verdict). The invariants are: every conformance claim is backed by evidence with provenance (no claim from recollection); every obligation traces to a source (no invented or orphaned promises); and drift is *surfaced for adjudication*, never silently resolved in either party's favor. Collapse any two of the three axes and the system stops being able to answer the only question it exists to answer — *did we do what we said?* — and becomes a second, prettier copy of the operational system that already can't.

### `svelte`

- **Title:** Svelte
- **Pairs with:** Svelte the language and compiler (versions 3–5, with the runes-based reactivity model as the canonical model in Svelte 5). Component-authoring concerns: reactivity primitives, props, snippets, lifecycle, scoped styles, transitions, actions, component-level state.
- **Touches principles:** #4, #5, #6, #7, #8
- **Preamble:** Svelte compiles components to imperative DOM operations rather than diffing a virtual DOM at runtime. That shifts where the work lands: more decisions move to author-time and compile-time, fewer to render-time. The principles below show where Svelte's compilation model and reactivity primitives change how axes get drawn. This pairing covers **the component language only** — framework concerns (routing, load, adapters, hooks, env) are out of scope.

### `sveltekit`

- **Title:** SvelteKit
- **Pairs with:** SvelteKit the application framework (2.x, v2.57.x as of May 2026). Routing, load functions, adapters, server/universal split, `$env`, hooks, form actions, remote functions, prerendering, error boundaries, `$app/state`, service workers, link previews, page options.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #4, #5, #7, #8, #14
- **Preamble:** SvelteKit is the application framework around Svelte the component language. It covers everything that turns components into an app: where a route lives, when its data loads, where its code runs (server, client, or both), how its environment is read, how its errors are handled, how it ships. These are the decisions a "use Svelte" choice doesn't make for you, and they accumulate fast. This pairing covers framework concerns only — component-authoring concerns (reactivity primitives, props, snippets, scoped styles) are out of scope.

### `tdd`

- **Title:** TDD
- **Pairs with:** Test-Driven Development (methodology)
- **Touches principles:** #1, #3, #4, #5, #6, #7, #9, #10, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** TDD's central move — write the test before the code — is itself an enactment of orthogonality: the test is the use-case axis, the code is the capability axis, and the red-green-refactor cycle keeps them honest by changing only one at a time. The principles below show where TDD already sits inside this collection's framing.

### `terraform`

- **Title:** Terraform (Infrastructure as Code)
- **Pairs with:** Declarative infrastructure provisioning with Terraform / OpenTofu (HCL) against any provider (Azure `azurerm`, AWS, GCP, Cloudflare, etc.). The **desired-state / apply** side of infrastructure: "describe what should exist, let the engine converge reality to it" — not imperative `az`/`aws`/`gcloud` scripting (that's a different axis), and not runtime configuration management (Ansible/Chef). Covers state, modules, the plan/apply lifecycle, drift, and the boundary between what Terraform can own and what it cannot.
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #13, #14
- **Preamble:** Terraform is the rare tool whose entire model *is* the principles made literal. Its **state file is "state lives in files" (#14) as a hard runtime fact** — the recorded reality the engine diffs against. Its **plan/apply split is "done means demonstrable" (#13)** — a plan is a claim, an apply is the demonstration, and `plan` showing no changes is the machine-checkable evidence. Its **declarative core is "honest bounds" (#9)**: the config asserts a desired end-state, and everything the config *doesn't* assert is, by omission, a claim that Terraform doesn't manage it. The traps in this domain are all about that last point — the gap between what the HCL *says* is managed and what *actually* is.

### `token-economy`

- **Title:** Token & Context Economy
- **Pairs with:** designing and operating LLM agent / prompt systems so the context window is spent where it earns fidelity and nowhere else — system-prompt and tool-description budgeting, retrieval-vs-inline trade-offs, per-turn injection, prompt-cache layout, and the cost/latency/attention axes they trade against. Applies whenever the goal is *measurable* economy — fewer tokens, faster turns, or cleaner attention — not "feels tighter."
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #4, #7, #9, #13, #16
- **Preamble:** Context engineering is where vibes go to lie, the same way perf tuning is. "This is leaner" is the single most expensive sentence in the domain — it justifies cuts that save nothing, drop load-bearing fidelity, or trade a per-session token for a per-turn one and net-lose. The principles below specialize for one discipline: **a token spend is a claim, and a claim needs a number, a frequency, and an honest bound.** The binding constraint is rarely raw size — it is usually *frequency* (what's paid every turn vs once a session), *duplication* (the same fact billed in three places), and *attention dilution* (the window so full the model stops reading the middle) — so the economy that matters is rarely the cut that's satisfying to make.

### `typescript`

- **Title:** TypeScript
- **Pairs with:** TypeScript (versions 4.x, 5.x, and 6.x). 6.0 shipped March 2026 as the last JavaScript-implemented release; `strict` is now the default, `target` defaults to `ES2025`, `module` to `esnext`, and `target: es5` is deprecated. TypeScript 7.0 will be a Go-native compiler rewrite. Applies to any project where TypeScript is the primary authored language — pure-library packages, application code, and codebases that transpile to JavaScript for runtime.
- **Touches principles:** #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #13
- **Preamble:** TypeScript's job is to make the engine surface (function signatures, exported types, public APIs) checkable before runtime. The principles below are about treating the type system as a real engine layer with its own range — not as documentation, not as decoration, and not as an obstacle to opt out of with `any`.

### `ui-ux`

- **Title:** UI/UX
- **Pairs with:** UI design as architectural discipline — vision and journey to screens, single-purpose screens, components as bounded units, design systems, visual hierarchy and typography, accessibility basics, and usability testing as the verification surface. Covers the structural and visual layer of UI work. Out of scope: the cognitive layer (mental-model formation, signifiers, recognition vs. recall, cognitive load) and the interaction-behavior layer (microinteractions, feedback timing, error recovery, gesture and modality, latency budgets).
- **Touches principles:** #1, #2, #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #13
- **Preamble:** UI work has three layers that pull on different design muscles: the **architectural and visual surface** (how the product is structured, how screens compose, what the design system says), the **cognitive layer** (how users build a working model of the system in their heads), and the **interaction-behavior layer** (what happens over time when the user acts). This pairing covers the first. It is about UI as architecture — vision, structure, component boundaries, design systems, visual hierarchy, accessibility surface. Get the architecture right and the other two layers have somewhere coherent to live.

### `visual-perception`

- **Title:** Visual Perception
- **Pairs with:** the perceptual layer of interface and information design — how the human visual system actually parses a screen before and during conscious reading: pre-attentive processing, gestalt grouping, visual scan behavior, color science and color psychology (with its evidentiary limits), shape semantics, typography legibility, motion perception, and the empirical interaction laws (Fitts, Hick) that govern target and choice design. Covers the *perception science* under layout, color, and shape decisions. Out of scope: the structural/design-system layer (screen composition, component boundaries, token architecture), the cognitive layer (mental-model formation), and the interaction-behavior layer (feedback timing, error recovery) — this pairing explains *why a rendering reads the way it does*, not how to architect the product around it.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #6, #8, #9, #10, #13
- **Preamble:** A screen is parsed twice: once by the visual system in the first ~200ms — involuntary, parallel, pre-attentive — and only then by deliberate reading. Layout, color, size, and shape decisions program the first parse whether the designer intends to or not. This pairing treats that first parse as an engineered surface with measurable properties: contrast ratios compute, target sizes measure, grouping distances compare, choice counts enumerate. Where the science is strong (pre-attentive channels, gestalt grouping, Fitts/Hick, legibility metrics, contrast perception) it gives numbers. Where the science is weak or popularly overstated (most color-emotion claims) it says so explicitly — an honest perceptual claim beats a confident decorating myth.

### `web-app-pentest`

- **Title:** Web Application Pentest
- **Pairs with:** Web application and server-rendered application penetration testing (skill / domain) — testing HTTP request/response surfaces, server-side request handlers, business-logic flaws, and input handling. Assumes an authorized context.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #6, #7, #13
- **Preamble:** A web application's security posture is a claim: every request handler validates its inputs and authorizes its caller correctly, across the entire space of requests an attacker can send. Web app testing probes that claim from the request edge — the one boundary the attacker fully controls. The principles below specialize for systematically mapping the request space and finding the handlers whose claims don't hold across it.

### `web-frontend`

- **Title:** Web Frontend
- **Pairs with:** Browser-based UIs (HTML, CSS, JavaScript or TypeScript). Applies to any project whose user surface runs in a web browser, regardless of framework choice.
- **Touches principles:** #4, #5, #6, #7, #8, #14
- **Preamble:** Browser UIs sit between two unforgiving environments: the network on one side (latency, failure, partial loads) and the user's hardware on the other (variable performance, input modalities, viewport sizes, accessibility constraints). The principles below are about staying coherent in the middle without leaning toward any particular framework.

### `windows-debugging`

- **Title:** Windows Servicing & Boot Recovery (offline / WinPE)
- **Pairs with:** Debugging and repairing unbootable Windows 10/11 (CBS/CSI component servicing, WinRE/Reset, DISM, BCD, kernel bugchecks) from an offline WinPE environment. Targets modern builds (Win11 24H2/25H2, build 26100/26200) with the checkpoint-cumulative-update + forward/reverse-differential servicing model.
- **Touches principles:** #2, #4, #9, #10, #13, #14, #15, #17
- **Preamble:** Offline Windows repair is unusually punishing because the system lies to you: logs name files that aren't the cause, "success" exit codes precede a box that still won't boot, version numbers that *look* wrong are often correct, and an edit you make can be silently reverted on next boot. The principles below specialize for a domain where **the only ground truth is "did it boot," and everything upstream of that is a claim to verify.**

## Prior context — read this first

This is **Phase 1** of the bootstrap flow: pairing selection. The
project's vision was already elicited and locked in Phase 0 and written
to `.agent/REPORTS/project-brief.md`.

**Before asking anything, read `.agent/REPORTS/project-brief.md` in
full.** It carries the vision, stack, user-facing surface, methodology,
constraints, expertise needed, and gaps. It is your **input** — your job
here is to map it onto the pairing catalog, not to re-elicit what it
already establishes (Principle 14 — don't re-ask what's already in a
file).

If no brief exists (e.g. `vision/` was skipped), fall back to a short
elicitation: ask only the few questions you need to recommend pairings —
vision in one sentence, stack/platforms, user-facing surface, committed
methodology, hard constraints — then proceed. Do **not** write the brief
file yourself in this fallback; that's Phase 0's job. Note the gap to the
user.

## Interview

Keep this short — the heavy elicitation already happened in Phase 0.

1. **Confirm the brief.** State back, in 2–3 sentences, what the brief
   establishes about the project (vision, stack, surface). Ask the user
   to confirm or correct. Correct the brief in conversation if needed,
   but the brief file is Phase 0's artifact — don't rewrite it here.
2. **Targeted follow-ups only.** Ask a question **only** when a
   pairing-relevant dimension is genuinely unclear from the brief —
   e.g. the brief says "embedded" but doesn't name the framework, and
   the framework decides between two candidate pairings. One good
   question, not a survey. If the brief is clear enough to recommend
   from, skip straight to the recommendation.

## Output format

Read the **Available pairings** catalog above, map the brief against it,
and produce the three sections below.

### Recommended pairings

For each pairing you recommend, give:

- **`<pairing-name>`** — one or two sentences on *why* it fits this
  project. Tie it to a specific thing in the brief (or the user's
  confirmation/correction of it).

Group recommendations into **core** (essential — without them the
project's pairings are incomplete) and **supporting** (relevant but
optional — pick up if bandwidth allows).

**Standing rule — graphical-UI projects get the user-perspective lens.**
If the brief's *user-facing surface* is **graphical** (a screen UI),
recommend **`jobs-to-be-done`** as a **core** pairing by default — the lens
that designs from the person and their job, models multi-role users, and
catches overloaded domain terms (a word that means two things to two roles).
Then confirm the brief carries a **Personas / roles** section; if it
doesn't, flag the gap so it gets added (that section is what the
seat-walkthrough design tool reads). Scale this down honestly: a
single-user tool needs one persona line, not a cast; a purely
programmatic / CLI surface doesn't need the lens at all.

### Gaps — domains not covered by existing pairings

For each domain the project needs that has no existing pairing, give:

- **`<proposed-name>`** — what the pairing would cover, why no existing
  pairing fits, and which sources the user could draw from.

Be honest about gaps. The user wants to know what's missing as much as
what's present. If there are no gaps, say so.

### Suggested `PROJECT-SCOPE.md` snippet

Produce a ready-to-paste markdown snippet for the "Pairings (optional)"
section of the project's `.agent/PROJECT-SCOPE.md`:

````markdown
## Pairings (optional)

- <pairing-name> — <reason from the brief>
- <pairing-name> — <reason>
````

This is advisory. The user commits the final selection by hand.

### Next step

Tell the user: once they've picked pairings, proceed to **Phase 2 —
scope elicitation** by running, from this directory:

```
bootstrap-project.sh <pairing1> <pairing2> ...
```

with the chosen pairing names. That generates the scope-interview pack
(which also reads the brief) and replaces the bootstrap `CLAUDE.md`.
